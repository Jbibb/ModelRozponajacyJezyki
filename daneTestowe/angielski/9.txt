Cephalization is an evolutionary trend in animals that, over many generations, the special sense organs and nerve ganglia become concentrated towards the rostral end of the body where the mouth is located, often producing an enlarged head. This is associated with the animal's movement direction and bilateral symmetry, and cephalization of the nervous system led to the formation of a functional centralized brain in three groups of bilaterian animals, namely the arthropods, cephalopod molluscs, and vertebrates (craniates).
Animals without bilateral symmetry

Cnidaria, such as the radially symmetrical Hydrozoa, show some degree of cephalization. The Anthomedusae have a head end with their mouth, photoreceptive cells, and a concentration of neural cells.[1]
Bilateria
Idealised bilaterian body plan. With a cylindrical body and a direction of forward movement the animal has head and tail ends, favouring cephalization by natural selection. Sense organs and mouth form the basis of the head.

Cephalization is a characteristic feature of the bilaterians, a large group containing the majority of animal phyla.[2] These have the ability to move, using muscles, and a body plan with a front end that encounters stimuli first as the animal moves forwards, and accordingly has evolved to contain many of the body's sense organs, able to detect light, chemicals, and gravity. There is often also a collection of nerve cells able to process the information from these sense organs, forming a brain in several phyla and one or more ganglia in others.[3]
